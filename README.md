# Book Search Engine

## Description

This project was refactoring a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end. In this project, I:

1. Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API
2. Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.
3. Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.
4. Deploy the application to Render.

Through this project, I learnt about:

- Apollo Server
- GraphQL
- MERN Setup
- TypeDefs and Resolvers
- Queries and Mutations
- useQuery and useMutation
- JSON Web Tokens
- Resolver Context

The image below shows the application on Render.
